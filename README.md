# Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

The aim of this project is to explore Reinforcement Learning approaches for Multi-Agent System problems. Multi-Agent Systems pose some key challenges which not present in Single Agent problems. These challenges can be grouped into 4 categories ([Reference](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05587)):
* Emergent Behavior
* Learning Communication
* Learning Cooperation
* Agent Modelling

We focus on learning communication and cooperation. 

We plan to implement RIAL and DIAL with parameter sharing, proposed by [Foerster et al., 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06676). The algorithms will be implemented on the Switch Riddle environment.

We also plan on implementing the MADDPG algorithm, for mixed cooperative and competitive environments, proposed by [Lowe et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02275)

We also have a [blog](https://marl-ieee-nitk.github.io) with articles on the several concepts involved in the project.
